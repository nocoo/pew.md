# pew.md

A pixel art twin-stick shooter in the browser, inspired by *Journey of the Prairie King* from Stardew Valley.

Built with Next.js 16, Bun, TypeScript (strict mode), and Tailwind CSS 4. All sprites are drawn purely in code — no image assets.

## Play

Move with **WASD** or **Arrow Keys**. Your cowboy auto-fires in the direction you're moving. Survive waves of bandits, collect power-ups, and climb the leaderboard.

### Power-ups (wave 3+, 25% drop on kill)

| Power-up | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| **Spread** | Fires 3 bullets in a fan pattern |
| **Rapidfire** | Doubles fire rate |
| **Pierce** | Bullets pass through enemies |
| **Nuke** | Instantly kills all enemies on screen |

## Tech stack

- **Runtime**: [Bun](https://bun.sh)
- **Framework**: [Next.js 16](https://nextjs.org) (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.9 (strict mode)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4
- **Database**: SQLite via `bun:sqlite`

```

**Rendering**: OffscreenCanvas at native 320x320, scaled 2x to 640x640 with `image-rendering: pixelated`.

**Anti-cheat**: Server issues HMAC-signed session tokens at game start. On game over, the client submits the token with the score. The server validates the signature, checks score/wave/duration plausibility, and prevents replay attacks.

## Development

```bash
# install
bun install

# dev server
bun dev

# lint + test
bun run check

# unit tests only
bun test

# build
bun run build
```

### Test coverage

73 tests across 9 files covering player mechanics, bullet physics, enemy AI, collision detection, wave progression, power-ups, anti-cheat validation, and database operations. Includes E2E game loop simulation.
